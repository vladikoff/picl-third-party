## Development

* enable (addon-sdk-1.14) sdk, use `source bin/activate`
* `cfx run` from project directory
* see Tools -> Sync with ...


### Grunt workflow

This allows for faster cfx reload.

* npm install
* grunt watch
* after you make changes to the project files, cfx will run.
* note: you need to close cfx first, before it can relaunch
